    Chart Combination

    Overview

    AnyChart architecture allows you to combine all types of featured charts. There two methods of combination: combination within one data plot and combination within a dashboard. The first way has some limitations - some types of chart can be combined and some - can not, dashboard allows you to combine everything, because it can contain several data plots arranged in the way you like. Below you will see a table presenting an availability if combination and samples for both ways.

    Available Combinations

    Many other chart vendors list different combined charts as a new chart type - in AnyChart we don't do that, because the number of charts will be out several hundreds. We just give you a very flexible method of combining different chart types, and you can combine not only two of them, but several types at once. Below both single data plot and dashboard combination methods are demonstrated and explained.

    Please note that an abilty to combine may depend on the swf file used .

    Combination within one data plot

    If you want to show to charts of the different types on the same data plot, all you need to do is to create several data series of the different (but combinable) types. Lets take a closer look at this method: we will combine Bar, Line and Bubble chart:

    The data tables for all three data series, note that all three series have the same arguments (names):

    Type	Column	Line	Bubble
    Values\Argument(s)	Y	Y	Y	Size
    Item A	90	10	100	10
    Item B	75	35	100	20
    Item C	50	50	100	30
    Item D	35	75	100	40
    Item E	10	90	100	50
    Now we need to convert this data to XML:

    XML Syntax
    XML Code
    Plain code
    01
    <data>
        02
        <series name="Bar series" type="Bar">
            03
            <point name="Item 1" y="90" />
            04
            <point name="Item 2" y="75" />
            05
            <point name="Item 3" y="50" />
            06
            <point name="Item 4" y="35" />
            07
            <point name="Item 5" y="10" />
            08
        </series>
        09
        <series name="Line series" type="Line">
            10
            <point name="Item 1" y="10" />
            11
            <point name="Item 2" y="35" />
            12
            <point name="Item 3" y="50" />
            13
            <point name="Item 4" y="75" />
            14
            <point name="Item 5" y="90" />
            15
        </series>
        16
        <series name="Bubble series" type="Bubble">
            17
            <point name="Item 1" y="100" size="10" />
            18
            <point name="Item 2" y="100" size="10" />
            19
            <point name="Item 3" y="100" size="10" />
            20
            <point name="Item 4" y="100" size="10" />
            21
            <point name="Item 5" y="100" size="10" />
            22
        </series>
        23
    </data>
    Now set this data section into AnyChart XML and the combined chart is ready:

    to top

    If now we will switch plot_type to "CategorizedHorizontal" - we will get a Bar, Line and Bubble combination Chart:

    XML Syntax
    XML Code
    Plain code
    01
    <chart plot_type="CategorizedHorizontal" />


    Live Sample:  Sample Combination Chart - Line Bar and Bubble

    And the last thing you need to know about chart combination within a data plot is the fact that you can use different axes to the series you combine, below we will plot a Stacked Column chart combined with a Line chart, Stacked Column will use an additional Y axis:

    To configure an extra axis you should use the following XML Settings (learn more about Extra Axes in Extra Axes Tutorial)

    XML Syntax
    XML Code
    Plain code
    01
    <axes>
        02
        <extra>
            03
            <y_axis name="y2" enabled="True">
                04
                <scale mode="Stacked" />
                05
            </y_axis>
            06
        </extra>
        07
    </axes>
    to top

    To bind bar series to this axis you should use y_axis attribute of <series> node:

    XML Syntax
    XML Code
    Plain code
    01
    <series name="Sample" type="Bar" y_axis="extra_y_axis_1" />

    Combination within a dashboard

    Dashboard option of AnyChart allows you to combine all featured types, actually allowing you to create several charts within one XML and specify how the should be displayed within one Flash movie. Learn more about dashboard building in Dashboard Tutorial.

    Below you can see a sample dashboard built using the data introduced above and a Pie chart - they can not be combined within a single data plot:
